# Right Whale Recognition
Right Whale Recognition Challenge on Kaggle

The project is based on the post "Which whale is it, anyway? Face recognition for right whales using deep learning  - Deepsense"
Deepsense's project is implemented by using Theano. But this project will implement using Tensorflow and add some variation.
